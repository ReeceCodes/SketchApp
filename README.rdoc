== README

This is pretty much a clone of etch a sketch. It is in javascript because that is what I am able to toy with during downtime.

Some ideas for improving:

-slow down the draw so that a picture can be seen being drawn

-save off a drawing

-use ruby/rails instead of html

-actually test on a phone...that was half the reason it's made that way

the sketch doc has my initial thoughts and how I planned it, I built the project but only the js is there and not even in the right spot yet
