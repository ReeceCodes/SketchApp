== README

This is pretty much a clone of etch a sketch. It is in javascript because that is what I am able to toy with during downtime.

Some ideas for improving:
-slow down the draw so that a picture can be seen being drawn
-save off a drawing
-use ruby/rails instead of html
-actually test on a phone...that was half the reason it's made that way
